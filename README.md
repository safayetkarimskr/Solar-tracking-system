How to make a solar tracking system?? for makeing help damo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zy0S6Lkxr1A Solar tracking system optical sensor  Features: • Auto OFF/ON switch  System Tracking. • Display Battery Percentage (%). • Consume less energy compared to existing system. • Wireless charging monitoring system with Android Application. • This electrical energy we will store in the battery and finally we will use it after evening showing the LED Indicator. • Perfect Tracking  System . Methodology  Actually photo electric effect is used for generating electricity. This electrical energy we will store in the battery and finally we will use it after evening. Solar sun light tracker and optical sensor is connected with Arduino UNO. Rotation angle and controlling will be done by the microcontroller IC Atmega-328. Microcontroller stores the C# programming code. Other people have not developed automatic switching system but I am going to do this thing with battery charge (%) showing in the display.
